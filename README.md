# OMDLib

OMDLib is a set of Lua helper methods and example mods to assist in developing mods for Orcs Must Die 3. This is a work in progress, and subject to change at any point.

## Sample Mods
`SpellbookMidWave` - Enables changing your loadout partway through the mission.
`ScrambleWave` **(Unfinished)**- Provides each player their choice of buff at the start of a level, and grants a choice of debuff at the start of each wave.
